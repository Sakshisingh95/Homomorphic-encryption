# Homomorphic Encryption Library Performance Analysis: A Comparative Study Across Python, Java, and C++

This kind of encryption exposes underlying data characteristics without revealing private information. There are a lot of libraries out there that perform this kind of encryption, but not a clear analysis of their performance and limitations. We decided to use three libraries to benchmark and analyze the results and performance.
Each library is written and used in a different language to broaden our analysis across multiple languages.

C++ library Microsoft SEAL [1]
Java library Homomorphic Encryption [2] 
Python Lang library: python-paillier [3]
